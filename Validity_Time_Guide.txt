1. Scope

The "Validity_Time" feature allows access to some pages (marked by the "VALIDITY_TIME" permission)
only to some users (marked by the "VALIDITY_TIME" permission) in their specific timeframe (defined as valid_from / valid_to).
The user can view their timeframe but cannot change it.
Only Admin can change the user's timeframe.
A user that is filtered out by Validity_Time get a specific error.
Admin is not affected by the Validity_Time filter.

2. Install

Explode the .tgz archive: it will replace existing files by overwriting them (!!!)

Exec the .sql: il will add two columns on users table (valid_from / valid_to) and add "VALIDITY_TIME" permission.

Select a page to protect (or create it) as Private page.
Associate it to permission "VALIDITY_TIME" from web menu, as usual.

Select a non-admin user (or create it).
Associate it to "VALIDITY_TIME" permission.
Define for it a timeframe (valid from / valid to):
you (admin) can do it in creation form, or modifying it under "Misc settings".

Et voil√†.
