1. Scope

The "Validity_Time" feature allows access to some pages (marked by the "VALIDITY_TIME" permission)
only to some users (marked by the "VALIDITY_TIME" permission) in their specific timeframe (defined as valid_from / valid_to).
The user can view their timeframe but cannot change it.
Only Admin can change the user's timeframe.
A user that is filtered out by Validity_Time get a specific error.
Admin is not affected by the Validity_Time filter.


2. Install

Explode the .tgz archive: it will replace existing files by overwriting them (!!!)

Exec the .sql: il will add two columns on users table (valid_from / valid_to) and add "VALIDITY_TIME" permission.

Select a page to protect (or create it) as Private page.
Associate it to permissions "User" and "VALIDITY_TIME" from web menu, as usual.

Select a non-admin user (or create it).
Associate it to "VALIDITY_TIME" permission.
Define for it a timeframe (valid from / valid to):
you (admin) can do it in creation form, or modifying it under "Misc settings".

Et voil√†.


3. Files description

In all existing files I isolated my additions with a "marker" like "Oscar: start" and "Oscar: End", so, if you like you can find very quickly all of it.

New files:
- usersc/scripts/did_not_have_time_permission.php = script called if user out of its timeframe. Now it call the file users/out_timeframe.php
- users/out_timeframe.php = error page specific from validity_time. This should be "Private" with "User" permission.

Files modified:
- users/admin_user.php = valid_from/valid_to fields added to form.
- users/admin_users.php = valid_from/valid_to fields added to form with default values suggested.
- users/helpers/us_helpers.php = validity_time check. Correction on permissionNameExists function.
- users/user_settings.php = show valid_from/valid_to in users list.
